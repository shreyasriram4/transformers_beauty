# Beauty Beyond Words: Multi-Label Ingredient-Attribute Classification

This repository implements a machine learning pipeline for multi-label classification of skincare product attributes based on textual metadata (ingredients and titles). The system uses a BERT-based model for predicting product attributes such as acne treatment, hydration, and oily skin. It also incorporates explainability techniques (LIME, SHAP, and Integrated Gradients) to analyze ingredient-attribute relationships.
